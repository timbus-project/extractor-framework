No arguments: Extracts info and displays in stdout

1st argument: Extracts to file. "y" for default name (extraction.json), anything else to define extracted file name;
2nd argument: Calls local debian software converter. "y" if jar is called "local-deb-software-converter-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar", anything else to define name of jar (or path);
3rd argument: Argument passed automatically to converter. It is the name of the extracted file (if there's no argument converter follows default behaviour - converts "extraction.json")
4th argument: To be passed to converter. It is the file name to which the extraction is going to be converted. Default is "conversion.owl".

Note: The conversion follows debian software converter structure and is to be updated accordingly.

To do: 
-Cleaning up;
-Dinamize argument input.
